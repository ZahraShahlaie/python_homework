# python_homework
This repository contains my responses to the practice questions from the Artificial Intelligence course conducted by IPM. In this course, we were required to answer a set number of questions, and I have prepared my responses in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Structure

This repository includes the following files:

- `README.md`: Project description file
- `exercises.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and reports for each question

## Key Topics

In these exercises, various topics and concepts of Python programming have been explored and utilized. Some of the most important ones are mentioned below:

- **Loops**: Using `for` and `while` loops to repeatedly execute blocks of code.

- **Conditionals**: Using `if-else` statements for logical decision-making in the program.

- **String Manipulation**: Performing various operations on strings, including slicing, replacing, counting, and reversing.

- **Lists and Dictionaries**: Sorting, searching, merging, and other operations on complex data structures.

- **Functions and Modules**: Defining and using functions to separate and reuse code.

- **Class and Objects**: Implementing object-oriented programming principles to define classes and create objects.

## Conclusion

This repository contains the exercises from the IPM Artificial Intelligence course, aimed at enhancing programming and data analysis skills. My responses to the questions demonstrate my ability to use Python concepts to solve various problems.

## How to Use
